This example demonstrates a common error in Tcl procedures where modifying a variable using `incr` does not necessarily mean the modified value will be returned. The procedure `badproc` increments the variable `a` but returns the value of the last command, which is the value of `b` instead of the incremented `a`. The solution shows how to correctly return the desired value using a variable and using the return value of the incr command directly.
